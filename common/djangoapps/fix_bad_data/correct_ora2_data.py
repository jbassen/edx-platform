    Created to fix a scoring problem caused by a bug in ORA2. This is a fix to mitigate
    the affects of that bug. (edx/edx-ora2#628)

    Fixes submission_score.points_earned for records affected by the track changes bug.
    Updates submission_scoresummary as a reult of this.
    Updates assessment_trackchanges.edited_content with a message from the course staff.
    
    To run this, create a file of TrackChanges ID's (see read_file method) and run the 
    "correct_ora2_scores" method from the command line.
